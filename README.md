# Obsidian AI Assistant  

This project was developed with the aim of making it easier to find and manage information in annotations made in **Obsidian**, transforming the software into a true intelligent assistant by means of **Artificial Intelligence (AI)**.  

## ðŸ“– About the project  

Obsidian is a powerful tool for taking notes and organizing ideas, allowing you to create connections between different pieces of content. However, as the volume of notes increases, finding specific information can become a challenge.  

With this in mind, this project combines **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and AI to:  
- Search for information in a contextual way.  
- Generate detailed answers based on stored annotations.  
- Facilitate data updating and management.  

## âœ¨ Features  

- Smart Search: Integration with embeddings to find relevant annotations.  
- Response Generation:** Uses the GROQ API to create natural, contextualized responses.  
- Storage and Updating:** Allows embeddings to be uploaded and updated as needed.  
- Modern Interface:** Developed with Streamlit, it offers a friendly and intuitive chat.  

## ðŸ”§ Technologies Used  

- Python  
- **Streamlit** for the web interface.  
- **Transformers** for generating embeddings.  
- GROQ API** for querying and generating responses.  
- **Scikit-Learn** for calculating the similarity of embeddings.  

## ðŸš€ How to Run  

### Prerequisites  
- Python 3.8+ installed.  
- Install the dependencies:  
  ```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
